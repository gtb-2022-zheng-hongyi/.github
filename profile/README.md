## Hi there 👋

<!--

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)

This is my first time to use windows terminal to edit a .md file.
Actually I still like to do this work by PyCharm or Intellij.

My name is Zheng.Hongyi.

I graduated from The Australian National University.

During the studying period, I learned some knowledge about machine learning.

To be honest, I really like it.

Apart from machine learning, data analysis is another thing that attracts me.

Finally, I hope I could have a good experience at ToughtWorks.
